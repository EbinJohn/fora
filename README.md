nginx configuration file
------------------------

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name local.foraproject.org;
    client_max_body_size 20M;

    location /pub {
        alias /home/jeswin/Desktop/repos/fora/server/www-user;
    }

    location /css {
        alias /home/jeswin/Desktop/repos/fora/server/app/www/css;
    }

    location /images {
        alias /home/jeswin/Desktop/repos/fora/server/app/www/images;
    }

    location /js {
        alias /home/jeswin/Desktop/repos/fora/server/app/www/js;
    }

    location /lib {
        alias /home/jeswin/Desktop/repos/fora/server/app/www/lib;
    }

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:9000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
}
                       
```      

/etc/hosts
----------
For development set local.foraproject.org to localhost  
You could use any other, but that's the path expected by the setup script.  


Setup
-----
The setup scripts put some data in the database. So that we can play with the app.  
It also helps in testing if the app is working fine. For the scripts to work, the web app must be running with the above config.  

cd to fora/server  
\#create the database  
node app/scripts/setup/setup.js --create  
\#delete the database  
node app/scripts/setup/setup.js --delete  
\#recreate the database  
node app/scripts/setup/setup.js --recreate  


Mongodb Security
----------------
Edit /etc/mongodb.conf  
bind_ip = 127.0.0.1  
port = MONGODB_PORT  


NODE_ENV
--------
To run the setup script, this must be set to 'development'.
This is done so that you don't accidentally destroy the production database.


NODE_PATH
---------
Because the path the node modules was changed, make this change in .bashrc  
export NODE_PATH="/usr/local/lib/node_modules"

Otherwise, you could run this as root:  
rm /usr/local/lib/node  
ln -s /usr/local/lib/node_modules /usr/local/lib/node
